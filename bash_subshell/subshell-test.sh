#!/bin/bash
# subshell-test.sh

(
# Inside parentheses, and therefore a subshell . . .
while true   # Endless loop.
do
  echo "Subshell running . . ."
done
)

#  Script will run forever,
#+ or at least until terminated by a Ctl-C.

exit $?  # End of script (but will never get here).



Now, run the script:
sh subshell-test.sh

And, while the script is running, from a different xterm:
ps -ef | grep subshell-test.sh

UID       PID   PPID  C STIME TTY      TIME     CMD
500       2698  2502  0 14:26 pts/4    00:00:00 sh subshell-test.sh
500       2699  2698 21 14:26 pts/4    00:00:24 sh subshell-test.sh

          ^^^^

Analysis:
PID 2698, the script, launched PID 2699, the subshell.

Note: The "UID ..." line would be filtered out by the "grep" command,
but is shown here for illustrative purposes.
